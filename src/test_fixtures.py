    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p class="1l5amll">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, the fast inverse square root algorithm is a method of
            computing x^(-1/2) using Newton's method with a clever initial guess. The algorithm was
            often misattributed to John Carmack, but actually originated earlier at Silicon Graphics.

        <p class="1l5amll">
            Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod. The magic constant 0x5f3759df provides an
            extremely good first approximation using bit-level hacking. The code reads:
            <code>i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1); // what the fuck?</code>
            This comment has become legendary in programming circles.
        </p>

        <p class="1l5amll">
            Tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. The algorithm was crucial for
            real-time 3D graphics when every CPU cycle counted. It computed the result about 4 times
            faster than the standard library function, enabling smooth gameplay in Quake III Arena.

            Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation. Modern CPUs have dedicated
            instructions for this operation, but the algorithm remains a masterpiece of optimization
            and a testament to the ingenuity of early game programmers.
