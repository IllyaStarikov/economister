# Legal Notice for Economister

## Why This Tool Is Legal

**Economister requires a valid Economist subscription and only works with legitimately accessed content.** The tool doesn't bypass paywalls or enable piracy—it simply reformats articles the user has already paid for into EPUB format for personal reading convenience. This practice, known as "format shifting" or "space shifting," has strong legal precedent supporting it as fair use.

The landmark *RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia* case established that converting content for personal portability is "paradigmatic non-commercial personal use." Just as converting CDs to MP3s for personal music players was ruled legal, converting web articles that users have subscribed to into e-reader format serves the same legitimate purpose. The Supreme Court's *Sony v. Universal* decision similarly protected personal copying for convenience, establishing that private, non-commercial use that doesn't harm the copyright owner's market constitutes fair use.

## The Fair Use Analysis

Under Section 107 of the US Copyright Act, four factors determine fair use, all of which favor Economister users with valid subscriptions. First, the purpose is purely personal and non-commercial—users are not selling or distributing the EPUBs. Second, The Economist publishes factual news content which receives less copyright protection than creative works. Third, while complete articles are being copied, courts have approved complete copying for personal convenience in both *Sony* (TV shows) and *Diamond Multimedia* (songs). Fourth, and most importantly, there's no market harm—users have already paid for access and aren't creating substitutes that would reduce The Economist's revenue.

## Authorized Access vs. Circumvention

Recent cases like *hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn* and *Van Buren v. United States* clarify that using authorized access for different purposes doesn't constitute hacking or illegal circumvention. When users log into The Economist with valid credentials, they are accessing content they have every right to view. The tool doesn't break encryption or bypass any actual Digital Rights Management (DRM)—it simply saves and reformats publicly served HTML that the browser already displays. This distinction matters legally: subscribers are exercising legitimate rights, not circumventing technological protection measures under the DMCA.

## Terms of Service Considerations

While The Economist's Terms of Service may restrict certain uses, contractual provisions cannot override established fair use rights under federal copyright law. The principle of copyright preemption, established in cases like *Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software*, prevents private contracts from eliminating user rights that copyright law explicitly protects. Additionally, blanket restrictions on personal format conversion in adhesion contracts (take-it-or-leave-it agreements) may be unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly when they eliminate decades-old consumer expectations like the ability to save articles for personal reading.

## How to Use Economister Legally

**To use Economister legally, users must maintain an active, paid subscription to The Economist.** The tool requires users to log in with their own credentials, ensuring they only access content they're authorized to view. Generated EPUBs should be used exclusively for personal reading—never distributed, sold, or shared with others. Users should keep EPUBs private and delete them if their subscription lapses. By following these guidelines, users engage in the same type of personal format shifting that courts have consistently recognized as legitimate fair use, similar to recording TV shows for later viewing or converting music for portable players.

## International Considerations

While this analysis focuses on US law where fair use protections are strongest, the principle of lawful access applies globally. A valid subscription establishes the user as a "lawful user" in EU terminology, distinguishing legitimate use from piracy. Countries like Australia and Canada explicitly permit format shifting for personal use, while even restrictive jurisdictions recognize that accessing content through legitimate subscriptions differs fundamentally from unauthorized access. However, users outside the US should consult local copyright law, as personal copying rights vary by jurisdiction.

## No Market Harm Principle

The absence of market harm proves crucial to Economister's legality. Users are not avoiding payment, reducing The Economist's revenue, or creating market substitutes. They have paid for access and are simply choosing to read that content on e-readers instead of in web browsers. This parallels accepted practices like printing web articles for offline reading or saving PDFs for personal archives. The Economist suffers no economic loss when a paying subscriber reformats articles for reading convenience, just as Sony suffered no harm when viewers recorded shows to watch at their convenience.

## Enforcement Patterns Support Personal Use

No copyright holder has successfully sued an individual for format shifting legitimately accessed content for personal use. Enforcement actions target commercial piracy operations and large-scale redistribution, not paying customers archiving content for personal convenience. Tools like Calibre have included news scraping features for years without legal challenge, and GitHub's reinstatement of youtube-dl after initial DMCA takedowns demonstrates platform recognition that tools serving legitimate purposes deserve protection. These patterns suggest that pursuing paying subscribers for personal format conversion would be both legally questionable and commercially self-defeating.

## Scholarly and Organizational Support

Leading copyright scholars including Lawrence Lessig and Pamela Samuelson explicitly support format shifting rights for legitimate users. The Electronic Frontier Foundation consistently advocates that personal space-shifting should be legally protected as it was for analog media. This consensus reinforces that converting subscription content for personal reading convenience aligns with copyright's fundamental purpose: promoting the progress of knowledge while respecting creators' rights. When Economister is used with a valid subscription, users exercise exactly the type of personal use rights that copyright law was designed to preserve.

## Summary

**Economister is legal when used with a valid Economist subscription for personal, non-commercial purposes.** The tool leverages well-established fair use principles, particularly format shifting rights recognized in major court decisions. By requiring legitimate login credentials and converting only content users have paid to access, Economister operates within the bounds of copyright law. While absolute legal certainty is rare in copyright matters, the convergence of statutory fair use protection, favorable case law, scholarly support, and enforcement patterns creates a robust legal foundation for personal format shifting by legitimate subscribers.
